# Live Win Prediction in IPL Matches

This project aims to provide real-time win predictions for Indian Premier League (IPL) matches. Using machine learning algorithms and live match data, the project predicts the probability of each team winning the match at any given point in time. This tool can be valuable for cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and broadcasters who want to understand the game's dynamics as it unfolds.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Processing**: Fetches live match data and processes it in real time.
- **Win Prediction Algorithm**: Utilizes machine learning models to predict the win probability for each team.
- **Visualization**: Displays the win probability in a user-friendly graphical format.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Analyzes past match data to improve prediction accuracy.
- **User Interface**: Interactive and easy-to-use interface for accessing predictions and insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **APIs**: Cricket data API for fetching live match data
- **Others**: Docker, Git

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vanshika1021/Live-win-prediction-in-IPL-matches.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Live-win-prediction-in-IPL-matches
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Start the backend server**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

6. **Install frontend dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

7. **Start the frontend server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

Once the servers are up and running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`. From there, you can view live win predictions for ongoing IPL matches. The application fetches live data, processes it through the machine learning model, and displays the win probability for each team.
